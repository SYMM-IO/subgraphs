# Symmio Subgraphs

## Deployment

To deploy Symmio Subgraphs seamlessly, utilize the provided Python script alongside the desired config file.

### Deploying Specific Subgraphs

You can specify which subgraphs to deploy. For example, to deploy only the `main` subgraph:

```bash
python deployer.py configs/bnb_8.json main
```

To deploy both `main` and `parties` subgraphs:

```bash
python deployer.py configs/bnb_8.json main parties
```

### Deploying All Subgraphs

If you want to deploy all subgraphs (`analytics`, `main`, and `parties`):

```bash
python deployer.py configs/bnb_8.json --all
```

**Note**: You must specify at least one subgraph or use the `--all` flag, else the script will not proceed.

## Preparing for Deployment (Without Actual Deployment)

In situations where you wish to have everything set up for deployment but prefer not to deploy it immediately on the hosted service, use the `--prepare-only` flag:

```bash
python deployer.py configs/bnb_8.json --all --prepare-only
```

Or, for specific subgraphs:

```bash
python deployer.py configs/bnb_8.json main parties --prepare-only
```

# Project Refactoring Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made during the refactoring of the project, specifically focusing on the reorganization and migration of subgraphs and their respective entities. The purpose of this refactoring is to optimize the structure of the project, improve maintainability, and consolidate data where appropriate.

### Original Subgraph Structure

The original project contained the following subgraphs:

1. **Analytics**
2. **FundingRate**
3. **Main**
4. **Parties**
5. **UserProfile**

### New Subgraph Structure

After refactoring, the project now contains the following subgraphs:

1. **Analytics**
2. **Quote** (previously "Main")
3. **Liquidation**

## Detailed Changes

### 1. **Main Subgraph**

-   **Rename**: The `Main` subgraph has been renamed to `Quote`.
-   **Entity Conversion**: Within the `Quote` subgraph, the entity previously known as `resultEntity` has been converted to `quote`.
-   **Liquidate Data Migration**: The data related to liquidation that was previously part of the `Main` subgraph has been migrated to a new subgraph named `Liquidation`.

### 2. **Liquidation Subgraph**

-   **New Subgraph**: A new subgraph named `Liquidation` has been created.
-   **Data Migration**: All liquidation-related data from the `Main` subgraph has been moved to this subgraph.
-   **New Data**: The `Liquidation` subgraph includes new data fields specifically related to liquidator profit.

### 3. **Analytics Subgraph**

-   **Consolidation**: The `Analytics` subgraph has been expanded to include data from the following removed subgraphs:

    -   **FundingRate**
    -   **Parties**
    -   **UserProfile**

-   **Removed Subgraphs**:
    -   The `FundingRate`, `Parties`, and `UserProfile` subgraphs have been removed entirely. All relevant data from these subgraphs has been integrated into the `Analytics` subgraph.

## Migration Summary

### Data Movement Overview

-   **From Main to Quote**:

    -   Renaming of the subgraph.
    -   Conversion of `resultEntity` to `quote`.

-   **From Main to Liquidation**:

    -   Migration of all liquidation-related data.
    -   Addition of new data on liquidator profit.

-   **From FundingRate, Parties, and UserProfile to Analytics**:
    -   Complete migration of all data from the removed subgraphs into `Analytics`.

### Entity Changes

-   **Quote Subgraph**:

    -   `resultEntity` â†’ `quote`

-   **Liquidation Subgraph**:
    -   Inclusion of new data fields for liquidator profit.
